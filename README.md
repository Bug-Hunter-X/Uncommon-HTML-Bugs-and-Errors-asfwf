# Uncommon HTML Bugs

This repository demonstrates several uncommon but potentially problematic errors in HTML.  These are beyond simple typos and syntax errors, and often lead to unexpected behavior or security vulnerabilities.

The `bug.html` file contains the buggy code. The `solution.html` provides corrected versions.  Each bug is explained in comments within the code.  Key areas covered include:

* Accessing non-existent attributes
* Using invalid CSS selectors
* InnerHTML sanitization
* Missing closing tags
* Conflicting IDs

This is a useful resource for learning about less obvious HTML issues and how to avoid them.
